## Exercise 1: Using the SDL

For this exercise, we will be building an API for an e-commerce website. Use the SDL to design the following GraphQL Schema:

  - Users can fetch a *Product* by name
  - Users can add a *Product* to a *Cart*
  - A user may query a *Cart* for all the *Products* added to it
  - Products have a title, and a description

```
schema {
  query Query
  mutation Mutation
}

type Query {
  # ?
}

type Mutation {
  # ?
}
```
